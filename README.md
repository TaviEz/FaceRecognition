# FaceRecognition

This project contains 2 main files to run. The first one is image comparison which compares if two images are the same. I created a folder named "images" from where you can make the comparisons. If you want to compare different images than those I chose you can simply change the path for the images on the 4th and on the 8th line in the image_comparison.py.
The second file is the main_video which detects your face by adding a detection square around your face and the name of yourself.
