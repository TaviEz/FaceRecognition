# FaceRecognition

This project contains 2 main files to run. The first one is image comparison which compares if two images are the same and sends a validation message in the console. I created a folder named "images" from where you can make the comparisons. If you want to compare different images than those I chose you can simply change the path for the images on the 4th and on the 8th line in the image_comparison.py.
The second file is the main_video which is the face recognition app itself. This app identifies your face by checking if a photo of you is in the "Images" folder.
After running the program the IDE will open a window in which you should see the recording captured by the camera. If the app recognizes your face, it will highlight your face with a red rectangle and on the bottom line you will see the name of the image which includes you.
